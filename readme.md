### HTML
The html mainly consists of 6 sections with paragraphs in the body and a header with an empty unordered list in the head.
### CSS
THE css contains styles for the buttons, sections and background.
### JavaScript
The javascript begins by collecting the sections and putting them into an array.
Then a loop take section names and make list items with them and place them into the empty unordered list.
Then an eventlistener is added to each of them where whenever anyone of them is clicked it will scroll to the appropriate section and get highlighted.
There's also an event listener that waits for scrolling and then it checks if the section is in the viewport and if it is it adds a class that makes the viewed sections appear more distinctively.
### Usage
This is used to make web pages more appealing and easier to navigate.
